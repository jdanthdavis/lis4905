## Justin Davis

### Week 5 Requirements:

1. *Chs. 16-18 in Python textbook.*
2. *Backward-engineer screenshot below:* README.md file should include the following items:
    1. *Screenshot of your Jupyter notebook (see below);*
    2. Upload .ipynb file and create link in README.md;
        *NOTE:* Before uploading .ipynb file, be sure to do the following actions from *Kernal* menu:
            a. *Restart & Clear Output*
            b. *Restart & Run All*
    *Note: Always* run the .py files before trying t ocreate a Jupyter notebook using the code from the .py files. If the .py files won't run, neither will the notebook!

#### Assignment Questions:
5. Give short, cogent answers to the following questions (in *your* words):
    - What is AI?
        - AI is intelligence shown by machines.
    - What is machine learning?
        - Machine learning is a type of AI that focues on algorithms.
    - What is deep learning and neural networks?
        - A neural network is a model after the human brain. Deep Learning is a type of AI that is based on neural networks.
    - What is natural language processing (NLP)?
        - NLP is a subfield of multiple fields within AI that focuses on the interactions between ML and the human language.
6. Research difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch:
    - What are they used for?
        - Both are used for deep learning.
    - List differences.
        - Static (Tensorflow) vs Dynamic (PyTorch) graphing.
        - Different types of debuggers.
        - Different model, audio, and graph visuals.
    - Why would you use one over the other?
        - I would pick TF because of the ease of deployment. TF also has better performance than PyTorch.
9. When runing program:
    - Document any issues.
        - Installation of TF and PyTorch within Conda.
    - Document solutions attempted.
        - Reinstall of Conda
        - Pip install of TF and Pytorch
    - How good was data model--compared to actual data (accuracy percentage)? 
        - Accuracy was 0.7322835%.
