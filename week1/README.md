# LIS4905 Directed Independent Study

## Mark K. Jowett, Ph.D.

### Week 1 Requirements:

1. Introductions
2. Course Overview
3. **Each** week, you will be doing **team work**.  
    First priority, agree upon a day/time meeting (approx. one hour) **by all**!
4. **Carefully** review our Bitbucket repo, then clone (**see below**):
    1. Self-contained.
    2. **NO** need to create another repo.
    3. **Goal #1:** Use the skills learned in this course to get a great ***JOB!***
    4. **Goal #2:** Build upon the skills acquired from each week!
    5. **Goal #3:** Learn how to use a DVCS as a ***team!***
    
5. **Meet as a Team! Then...**
   
    1. **Work through *any* errors below with your team members.  
    Also, chronicle any errors *and* solutions in *your* README.md file!**  
    
    2. Review:  
        a. **[Git and Git Workflow Resources](../resources/README.md "Git and Git Workflow Resources")**  
        b. **[Git Guide](../resources/git_guide.md "Git Guide")** for any assistance needed!  
        c. **Research** your own solutions! :)  
      
    3. **Clone this course repo:**  
    You can do **anything** you want--**except** to the directories and files that I create!
      
    4. **Everyone**, create a sub-directory in the repo's ***root*** directory:  
        a. Using ***yourfsuid*** in lower-case, and  
        b. Include a **README.md** file, ***with SOME CONTENT!***.  
      
    5. **After** having reviewed the resources above:  
    **push** your local **updated** lis4905_sum21 repo to our remote repo.
          
    6. **fetch** or **pull** the updated repo (your choice ;).
    
    7. Be polite (or, sarcastic, if you want, in a nice way ;), and post one line (or, more if you like :) in each of your colleagues' README.md files.
      
    8. **After** correcting ***any*** issues ***as a TEAM,*** push changes to our repo.
