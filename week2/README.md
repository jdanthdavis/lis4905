# LIS4905 Directed Independent Study

## Mark K. Jowett, Ph.D.

### Week 2 Requirements:

1. [Team Work: One File](../projects/README.md#team-git-practice "Team Git Practice") Requirements
2. Distributed Version Control (**only** if Git not installed): [Git and Bitbucket](http://www.qcitr.com/usefullinks.htm#lesson3b "Git and Bitbucket")
3. Development Installations:
    1. Anaconda Individual FREE version (includes Python, R, etc.):  
        [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/)  
        [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
        
        1. **BE SURE** to get Python 3+ version. *Note:* Don't need to register, if you don't want to.
            1. Windows: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
                
            2. Mac: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)  
                **Mac Users** note: [https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-successfully-install-anaconda-on-a-mac-and-actually-get-it-to-work-53ce18025f97](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-successfully-install-anaconda-on-a-mac-and-actually-get-it-to-work-53ce18025f97)
            
        2. Verify installation: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/)  
         **Note: Use the Command-Line Interface (CLI), *not* Anaconda Navigator (GUI).**
         
    2. Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    
        1. Python in Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)  
        2. Getting Started with Python in VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)  
        3. **Be Sure** to carefully review (How to Write Python): [https://realpython.com/lessons/what-pep-8-and-why-you-need-it/](https://realpython.com/lessons/what-pep-8-and-why-you-need-it/)  
         
    **Windows Users:**
    > On Windows, the PATH environment variable is no longer changed by default, as this can cause trouble with other software.  
    > The recommended approach is to instead use Anaconda Command Prompt (located in the Start Menu under "Anaconda").  
    > (Note: recent Win 10 does not assume you have privileges to install or update. If the command fails, right-click on the Anaconda Command Prompt,  
    > choose "More", choose "Run as administrator")
   
4. **Test Installation:** README.md file should include the following items:
    1. **Screenshot of a1_tip_calculator application running using IDLE (see below);**
    2. **Screenshot of a1_tip_calculator application running using Visual Studio Code (see below);**
    3. Upload A1 .ipynb file and create link in README.md;  
    **Note:** *Before* uploading .ipynb file, *be sure* to do the following actions from **Kernal** menu:  
        a. **Restart & Clear Output**  
        b. **Restart & Run All**  
        
    4. **Helper Video: http://qcitr.com/vids/lis4369_A1.mp4**  
    
    **Note:** **Always** run the .py files *before* trying to create a Jupyter notebook using the code from the .py files. If the .py files won't run, neither will the notebook!
